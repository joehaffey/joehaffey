Hello.  I'm Joe Haffey and I'm a computer nerd.  I got my start back in 1995/96 with a Windows 95 computer (AAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!) That thing was a pice of crap.  It locked up every night at least once and I had to reboot all the time.  Plus in those days (dial-up internet) a download would take 3 days and it would get to 98% or 99% and crash.(again, AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!)

Five years ago, I was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrilation which ended my truck driving career.  That sent me for a loop and it took a while to recover.  So after much thought, I've decided to become a web designer/developer.  However, I seek to become a full stack developer so I can take on more different types of projects and work as a freelancer.  I'm going to educate myself because I don't have faith in the educational system anymore. 

This is what I do during the day.  By night, I'm a musician who is getting ready to release his debut album.  Up until about four years ago I was a guitar player but arthritis in my hands put a stop to that.  Now I make music with my computer.  My side hustle is trading in the financial markets.  Right now I just do stocks but I intend to branch out into options, futures, and commodities.  

I've decided to make Python my first language.  I'm using Python because it tends to be forgiving of mistakes, unlike languages like C (which I know a little of)  Thank you Guido Von Rossum!!!!!  The other languages I will learn are PHP, Ruby, Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS.  Plus, I'm trying to find sources of information about web server administration as I have a reseller account with Resellers Panel.
